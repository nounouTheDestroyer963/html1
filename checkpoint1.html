            <h3>WORK</h3>
            <p>Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of working in a variety of kitchens—from fine dining restaurants to private events and bespoke culinary experiences. My approach is rooted in technique, guided by seasonality, and inspired by both tradition and innovation. I specialize in [insert specialties, e.g., modern French cuisine, Mediterranean flavors, or plant-based dishes], always aiming to create meals that are both refined and deeply satisfying. Whether I’m designing a personalized menu, leading a culinary team, or preparing an intimate dinner, I bring dedication, creativity, and attention to detail to every aspect of my work. Today, I’m proud to run my own restaurant, where I bring my culinary vision to life every day. After years of working in various kitchens and refining my craft, having my own space allows me to fully express my style—balancing tradition with creativity, and focusing on seasonal, high-quality ingredients. I design each menu with care, aiming to offer a unique and honest dining experience that reflects my journey as a chef. Whether it’s a simple dish or a multi-course tasting menu, everything is prepared with passion, precision, and a deep respect for the ingredients.
